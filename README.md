- **Built-in Logic or Knowledge Base** – Retrieves answers or executes steps.  
- **Scriptable Modules** – Includes `ProductA.py`, `ProductB.py`, `ProductC.py` for modular functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- A command-line environment (e.g., Terminal, PowerShell)  
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `conda`

### Usage
